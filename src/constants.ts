    What is Lorem Ipsum?
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
    ::
    Why do we use it?
    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text.

    Why are you doing this?
    Because I hate writing filler text.

    static FRESHPRINCE = `Now, this is a story all about how
    My life got flipped-turned upside down
    And I'd like to take a minute
    Just sit right there
    I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
    In West Philadelphia born and raised
    On the playground was where I spent most of my days
    Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
    And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
    When a couple of guys who were up to no good
    Started making trouble in my neighborhood
    I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
    She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
    I begged and pleaded with her day after day
    But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
    She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
    I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it"
    First class, yo this is bad
    Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
    Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
    Hmm, this might be alright
    But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
    Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
    I don't think so
    I'll see when I get there
    I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
    Well, the plane landed and when I came out
    There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
    I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here
    I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
    I whistled for a cab and when it came near
    The license plate said, "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror
    If anything I could say that this cab was rare
    But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air"
    I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
    And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo holmes, smell ya later"
    I looked at my kingdom
    I was finally there
    To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air`;
